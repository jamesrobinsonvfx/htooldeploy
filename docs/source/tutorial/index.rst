Tutorial
========

In the following tutorial, we will look at how to install a tool in Development
Mode, make a change, then install the tool for real to our home folder.

Inside the ``examples`` folder you can find a folder called ``test_tool``.
This is a dummy tool consisting of an otl called **Example: Test Tool** which
depends on an external Python library. There is also a shelf, **Test Tool**
with a few tools that run scripts to pop up some dialogs.
