Install Test Tool Using Development Mode
========================================

Now that we're all set with the example tool repo and understand its
structure, let's install it!

Development Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First let's install :ref:`Test Tool` in :ref:`Development Mode`. This will keep
all the source files in place, but create a Houdini Package and add the tool's
source to the ``HOUDINI_PATH``. We can keep editing the source code in the
``~/dev/tools`` directory until we want to install :ref:`Test Tool` for real.
