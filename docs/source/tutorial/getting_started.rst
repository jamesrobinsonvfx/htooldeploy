Getting Started
===============

In order to get started with the tutorial, we first need to grab the
:ref:`Test Tool` source code from GitHub.

For this project, I've chosen to clone the tool repo into my ``~/tools`` folder
Feel free to use any folder you like.
::
    cd ~/tools
    git clone https://github.com/jamesrobinsonvfx/htooldeploy.git
