Getting Started
===============

In order to get started with the tutorial, we first need to grab the
:ref:`Test Tool` source code from GitHub.

For this project, I've chosen to clone the tool repo into my ``~/dev`` folder.
Feel free to use any folder you like.
::

    cd ~/dev
    git clone https://github.com/jamesrobinsonvfx/htooldeploy-test_tool.git
